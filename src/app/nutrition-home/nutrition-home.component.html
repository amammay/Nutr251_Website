<h1>
  Fast Food
</h1>
<p class="wrap-text">
  Just as a quick intro, there is so much conjecture in the weight loss cult of personality out there which rallies against
  any form of fast food. While it is certainly true that you can pack on some massive calories at many fast food chains,
  itâ€™s certainly not inevitable with a little knowledge and planning. If anything, many fast food restaurants are becoming
  more friendly to calorie counters, not less. Even the mighty Taco Bell (owned by Pepsi Co. consequently) now has a big
  name nutritionist on full time staff making recommendations for menu changes. For the purposes of this guide, I will point
  to menu items or combinations that are mostly 550 calories or less, making it possible to squeeze these meals in on most
  any day and still be able to stay under your calorie goal.
